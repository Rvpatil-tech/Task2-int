Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization on Titanic Dataset 🚢📊  

This Task focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights. The key aspects covered in this analysis include identifying trends, handling anomalies, and deriving meaningful conclusions through statistical and visual representations.  

The following steps were carried out in this analysis 🔍  

- Patterns in the dataset were explored to understand trends and behaviors among passengers 🧐  
- Data anomalies were detected and addressed to maintain data integrity ⚠️✔️  
- Relationships between features were examined using a correlation matrix to identify dependencies 🔗  
- Summary statistics were generated to obtain an overall understanding of the dataset 📈  
- Feature-level insights were drawn from visualizations to understand the impact of different attributes on survival 🎭  
- Statistics for various fields were derived, including survival rate, passenger class distribution, and gender distribution 🧑‍🤝‍🧑  
- Histograms were created for numeric features to observe their distributions 📊  

These steps provided a comprehensive understanding of the Titanic dataset, revealing key factors influencing passenger survival and other significant trends. The analysis enables data-driven decision-making by leveraging statistical measures and visualization techniques to extract valuable information from the dataset 💡🚀
